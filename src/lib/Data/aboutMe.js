  <p>My name is Miguel Freitas, I am a software engineer from Portugal with a passion for <strong>Web Development</strong>. I'm very passionate about technology and I am always eager to learn new things. This website itself is my first crack at using Svelte as it was a framework I wanted to try out for a while now. 

Working freelance in the development of <a style="color:black; font-weight:bold"  href='https://www.jn.pt/3729560853/aplicacao-para-ajudar-a-controlar-a-ingestao-compulsiva/'> eMOTE</a> has given me a strong foundation in Front-End and Full-Stack Web Technologies, having accompanied the project from the requirements gathering phase all the way to its deployment. This has given me great experience in working with clients and understanding their needs, as well as valuable insight into the complete Software Development Life Cycle.

 I have just finished my Master's degree in Informatics Engineering at <a style="color:black; font-weight:bold" 
 href='https://fe.up.pt'> FEUP</a>, where I developed a strong background in software development practices and problem-solving skills.  My thesis was focused on the development of a <strong>user-friendly</strong> web-based editor for historians and museum curators to create experiences tailored around cultural heritage locations. This has profoundly deepened my appreciation for <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>user-centered design. </strong>
  This project has sparked a greater focus on creating intuitive interfaces that cater to diverse user needs, ensuring that the tools I build are not only powerful but also <strong>inclusive</strong> and <strong>easy to navigate</strong>. It has reinforced my commitment to front-end development practices that prioritize <strong>accessibility</strong> and deliver seamless, enjoyable user experiences for all.

   I am always looking for new challenges and <strong>opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</strong> 
   In my free time, I enjoy <strong>playing video games</strong>, <strong>reading manga </strong>, <strong>watching anime</strong>,
    and <strong>playing the flute</strong>. I also like to explore the outdoors and go on hikes, as you can see in the <a style="color:black; font-weight:bold"  href='/photos'>Pictures page</a>.
